    <h1>❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p>Common questions about usage, setup, and limitations of K-HOLE.</p>

    <h2>Q: Is K-HOLE safe to run?</h2>
    <p>A: K-HOLE is only safe in controlled environments that you fully own or have permission to test. Never use it on public infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>Q: Why is my proxy/TOR setup not working?</h2>
    <p>A: Make sure the TOR service is running and listening on port 9050/9051, and that your controller password is configured correctly.</p>

    <h2>Q: How do I install missing dependencies?</h2>
    <p>A: Run <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>. If an error persists, install individual modules manually using pip.</p>

    <h2>Q: What protocols does K-HOLE support?</h2>
    <p>A: Layer 3/4/7 (TCP, UDP, HTTP, WebSocket), Amplification, Industrial Protocols (Modbus), Game (Steam A2S), VoIP, IoT (MQTT, CoAP).</p>

    <h2>Q: Can I use my own payloads?</h2>
    <p>A: Yes. Use the Custom Payload Editor or load external `.txt` or `.json` files into flood methods that support it.</p>

    <h2>Q: Is there a GUI version?</h2>
    <p>A: Not yet. K-HOLE is currently command-line and terminal styled, but a GUI frontend is being considered.</p>

    <h2>Q: My attack isn't working—what's wrong?</h2>
    <p>A: Verify target IP/hostname, port number, payload format, and method compatibility. Try a different method or scan the target first.</p>
